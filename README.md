## Project overview

This app provides the typical Classboard functionality (class and user management, announcements, resources, and schedules) and extends it with productivity-focused features: the ability to mark courses as important, let class reps manage importance for their course members and also let each members set their own importance, and set reminders/notifications for important dates and course updates.

## Key features

- **Class Management and user enrollment:** Classes would be managed and created by class reps and admins. Users can enroll in classes via unique codes or invitations. Lecturers are also created and assigned to classes by class reps/admins.

- Announcements and resource sharing (files, links, rich text)

- Calendar / schedule view with day/week/month modes

  - Display events (classes, deadlines, exams) with multiple granular views and timezone awareness.
  - Data: Event entity with start/end, recurrence rules (RRULE), reminders/notifications.
  - Performance: fetch events by visible date range, cluster overlapping events, lazy-load details.
  - Gotcha: handle DST and recurring-event edits carefully (single instance vs series).

- Role-based access (student / class rep / teacher / admin)

  - Define roles and granular permissions (RBAC), ideally with a roles table and permission matrix.
  - Enforce on both client and server: UI hides actions, API validates permissions on every request.
  - Consider impersonation or audit logging for admin actions.
  - Gotcha: don’t trust client-side role checks — always validate on server and protect sensitive endpoints.

- Responsive, accessible UI

  - Mobile-first responsive design (flexbox/grid), breakpoints, and progressive enhancement.
  - Accessibility (a11y): semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA where necessary, color-contrast, screen-reader announcements.
  - Testing: run axe or Lighthouse checks and include keyboard-focused manual tests.
  - Gotcha: complex components (calendars, rich-text editors) often need custom a11y work.

- API-first architecture for extensibility
  - Design REST/GraphQL APIs as first-class artifacts with versioning, clear contracts, and OpenAPI/GraphQL schema docs.
  - Separate frontend/state from backend logic; support third-party integrations and webhooks.
  - Dev ergonomics: mock servers, Postman/Swagger, and automated API tests.
  - Gotcha: breaking changes — use API versioning and deprecation policies.

## Advanced features

- Important / Starred courses
  - Users can mark any course as important (star/bookmark).
  - Class reps may be granted permission to mark courses important for their class.
- Reminders & notifications
  - Create one-off and recurring reminders for exams, assignments, important classes, and resources.
  - Reminders can be scheduled, snoozed, and set with custom priority and expiration.
  - Delivery channels: in-app, email, and optional push notifications (configurable per user).
  - Calendar sync (ICS export / Google / Outlook) for reminders and events.
- Subscription & digest
  - Subscribe to course updates, announcements, or specific resource threads.
  - Daily/weekly digest emails summarizing important items and upcoming reminders.
- Permission controls & audit
  - Fine-grained permissions for class reps (who can post announcements, mark importance, or manage reminders).
  - Audit logs for administrative actions.
- Offline & sync
  - Local caching for basic read access and queued actions while offline.
- Import/export
  - Import course lists and export schedules/reminders as ICS or CSV.

## Tech stack

- Frontend: React + TypeScript (or preferred framework), Tailwind or CSS-in-JS
- Backend: Node.js + Express (or preferred), REST or GraphQL API
- Database: PostgreSQL (SQLite for local dev)
- Tooling: Vite / Webpack, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Jest/Testing Library

## Repository layout

- /src — frontend source code
  - /components — reusable UI components
  - /pages — top-level routes
  - /services — API clients and data layer
  - /styles — global styles and design tokens
- /server — backend API
  - /controllers
  - /models
  - /routes
  - /jobs — background jobs (reminders, digests)
- /migrations — DB migrations
- /scripts — helper scripts
- README.md — this file
- .env.example — required environment variables

Adjust layout to match the actual repo if different.

## Getting started (local)

1. Clone the repo
   git clone <repo-url>
2. Install dependencies
   cd classboard-redesigned
   npm install
   (or yarn)
3. Copy environment example and edit
   cp .env.example .env
   - Configure DATABASE_URL, PORT, email provider, and push credentials if used
4. Start the app (development)
   npm run dev
5. Open http://localhost:3000 (or configured port)

If frontend/backend are separate:

- Start backend: cd server && npm run dev
- Start frontend: cd src && npm run dev

## Development

- Recommended Node version: specify with .nvmrc or engines in package.json
- Run type checks:
  npm run typecheck
- Format code:
  npm run format
- Commit hooks:
  Husky runs linters and tests before commit/push

## Testing & linting

- Run tests:
  npm run test
- Run linters:
  npm run lint

Add/update tests for new features. Prioritize unit tests for core logic (reminders, permissions) and integration tests for API endpoints.

## Deployment

- Build for production:
  npm run build
- Provide environment variables via the hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, AWS)
- Run DB migrations and background job workers (for reminders and digests)
- Configure email / push providers and secrets in production

## Security & privacy

- Do not commit secrets. Use .env and host secret management.
- Validate and sanitize all user input on the server.
- Use HTTPS in production and secure cookies / tokens.
- Rate-limit reminder creation and notification endpoints to prevent abuse.

## Contributing

- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests.
- Fork, create a feature branch, implement changes, add tests, and open a pull request.
- Follow the repository's code style, run linters, and keep commits atomic and descriptive.

## Troubleshooting

- Common issues:
  - Missing environment variables: check .env against .env.example
  - DB connection failures: verify DATABASE_URL and run migrations
  - Notification failures: verify email/push provider credentials
  - Port conflicts: change PORT in .env
